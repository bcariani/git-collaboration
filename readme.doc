Task 1: Fast-forward merges
neat_branch merge: Neat_branch is two commits ahead of develop. When we merge neat_branch into develop, we simply move where develop is pointing forward to match where neat_branch is pointing. 
messy_branch merge: Same logic here as neat_branch. Messy_branch is two commits ahead of develop. When we merge messy_branch into develop, we simply move where develop is pointing forward to match where neat_branch is pointing.
